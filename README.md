ğŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Aki Praveen

Software Engineer at Athelas â­•

Currently solving problems related to backend engineering, databases, and embedded software. Really interested in distributed systems at the moment.

In my spare time, I'm heading up student-taught courses at the University of Maryland, and also finishing up my undergrad CS degree because that's apparently the industry standard right now.
