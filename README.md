# ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Aki Praveen

Software Engineer at Athelas â­• solving problems related to backend engineering, databases, and embedded software.

Currently really interested in distributed systems & parallel programming. 

Favorite coursework:
* CMSC818E Distributed Systems
* CMSC498X Parallel Programming
* CMSC216 Computer Systems

In my spare time, I'm heading up student-taught courses at the University of Maryland, and also finishing up my undergrad CS degree because that's apparently the industry standard right now.
