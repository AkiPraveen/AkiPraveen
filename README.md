# ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Aki Praveen

Software Engineer at Athelas â­• solving problems related to backend engineering, databases, and embedded software.

Currently really interested in distributed systems & parallel programming. 

Some of my UMD coursework that I'd like to make use of in my career:
* CMSC818E Distributed File Systems
* CMSC818X Parallel Computing
* CMSC433 Concurrency
* HACS408T IoT Security


In my spare time, I'm heading up student-taught courses at the University of Maryland (the [STICs](http://stics.umd.edu) program), and finishing my b.s. in computer science, along with my degree.
