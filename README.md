# 👋 Hi! I'm Aki Praveen

Software Engineer at Athelas ⭕ solving problems related to backend engineering, databases, and embedded software.

Currently really interested in distributed systems & parallel programming. Ask me about the distributed filesystem I'm working on recreating based on a few of the papers I've been looking at! Email [me (at) akilesh.xyz](me@akilesh.xyz) ✉️
